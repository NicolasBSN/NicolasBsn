Hi, My name is Nicolas and I am currently in a Master's Degree of Data Science at Ecole Polytechnique. This Github contains some of my work that I have done during my labs or my free time. The purpose of this, is to give you an overview of my previous work ! I'll also upload content at a regular basis !
