### Hi, my name is Nicolas and I am currently in a Master's Degree of Data Science at Ecole Polytechnique.

### ⚡️ The purpose of this Github
<br />
This Github contains some of my work that I have done during my labs or my free time. The purpose of this, is to give you an overview of my previous work. I'll also upload content at a regular basis !

### ⚒️ How it is structured
<br />
You'll find below a repo per lecture, with a name and a Roman Numeral that indicates the degree of progress of a particular lecture.
